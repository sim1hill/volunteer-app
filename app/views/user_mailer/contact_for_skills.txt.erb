Hi <%= @user.name %>,
      I'm reaching out for help because of the skill(s) you listed on your Volunteerly profile. 
      Your skills: 
      <% @user.skills.each do |skill| %>
      <%= skill.name %>
      <% end %> 
 

      I'd love to organize a time to share our skills. 
 <%= link_to('Check out my Volunteerly profile', users_url(@user.id), method: :patch) %>. Also feel free to contact me directly at <%= @sender.email %>
   Note: You may have to sign in to your Volunteerly account to view my profile first.

I can't wait to hear from you.
  -- <%= @sender.name %>
